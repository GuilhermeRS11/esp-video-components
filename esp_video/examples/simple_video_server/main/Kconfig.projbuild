    config EXAMPLE_CAMERA_VIDEO_BUFFER_NUMBER
        int "Camera video buffer number"
        default 2
        help
            Number of video buffers for the camera sensor.
            
            More buffers provide better performance and reduce frame drops,
            but consume more memory. Recommended range: 2-4 buffers.
            
            - 2 buffers: Minimum for basic operation
            - 3-4 buffers: Better performance for smooth streaming
            - Higher values: May improve performance but increase memory usage

    config EXAMPLE_JPEG_COMPRESSION_QUALITY
        int "JPEG compression quality (%)"
        default 80
        range 1 100
        help
            JPEG compression quality percentage (1-100).

            Higher values produce better image quality but larger data streams:
            - 90-100: Excellent quality, high bandwidth usage
            - 70-90: Good quality, moderate bandwidth (recommended for UVC)
            - 50-70: Acceptable quality, lower bandwidth
            - 1-50: Poor quality, minimal bandwidth

            For UVC streaming, consider the USB bandwidth limitations
            and host system capabilities when choosing quality level.

            Recommended: 80 for balanced quality and performance.

    config EXAMPLE_HTTP_PART_BOUNDARY
        string "HTTP part boundary"
        default "123456789000000000000987654321"
        help
            HTTP multipart boundary string used for MJPEG streaming.
            
            This boundary separates different parts in the HTTP multipart response.
            Must be unique and not appear in the video data. The default value
            is designed to be unique and safe for most applications.
    
    config EXAMPLE_MDNS_INSTANCE
        string "mDNS instance"
        default "web-cam"
        help
            mDNS instance name for service discovery.
            
            This name will be used to identify the camera service on the network.
            Other devices can discover this camera using this instance name
            through mDNS/Bonjour protocols.
    
    config EXAMPLE_MDNS_HOST_NAME
        string "mDNS host name"
        default "esp-web"
        help
            mDNS host name for the ESP32 device.
            
            This hostname will be used for network identification and can be
            accessed as "esp-web.local" on the local network (if mDNS is supported
            by the client device).
